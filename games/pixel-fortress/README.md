A 2D pixel-based strategy game that uniquely merges the depth of Tower Defense with the addictive simplicity of Clicker styles.

‚û°Ô∏è [Play live](https://dorianbayart.github.io/sandbox/games/pixel-fortress/)




## ‚ú® Features

* **Strategic Gameplay:** Build up your Fortress to produce units and defend your fortress against enemies.
* **Dynamic Map:** Explore huge randomly generated maps with various terrains and obstacles.
* **Unit Management:** Control multiple units with unique abilities and stats.
* **Zoom:** Use the mouse wheel to zoom in and out for a detailed view of the battlefield.
* **Pathfinding:** Units intelligently navigate the map to reach their destinations.

## üéÆ Game Modes

**Single-player (vs AI):** Currently, the game can be played against an AI opponent. This mode allows you to practice and familiarize yourself with the game mechanics, through campaigns, and predefined or randomly generated maps.

**Multiplayer (vs Player):** Multiplayer functionality will hopefully be added in a future release. This will allow you to play against other players online and compete for dominance on the battlefield.  
Stay tuned for updates! 


## üíª Technologies Used

* **HTML/2D Canvas:** Provides the structure and visuals of the game.
* **JavaScript:** Handles game logic, rendering, and player interactions.
* **Pixi.js:** Used for rendering, animation and in-game UI.
* **Web Workers:** To enhance performance, the pathfinding calculations are offloaded to a web worker thread.


## üïπÔ∏è Game Mechanics (Brief Overview)

* **Unit Management**  
In Pixel Fortress, you build structures that automatically produce units. These units operate independently, with some dedicated to resource gathering (food, wood, gold, stone, whatever) and others focused on combat against enemy units and structures. You don't directly control individual units; instead, you manage your resource production and building placement to optimize your unit's effectiveness.  
The AI opponent uses the same automated unit management system.

* **Attack**  
Units automatically attack nearby enemies within their range or navigate to engage them.
