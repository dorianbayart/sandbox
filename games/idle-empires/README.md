# Idle Empires

Idle Empires is a multiplayer incremental idle game where players manage their own empires, generating resources, upgrading buildings, and competing with other players.

## Core Gameplay

Players build and upgrade various buildings to generate resources, train troops, and expand their empires.  The goal is to accumulate resources, grow your population, achieve high Prestige levels, and ultimately build the most powerful empire.

## Resources

*   **Gold:** Primary currency. Generated by Mines.
*   **Wood:** Used for building and some upgrades. Generated by Lumber Mills.
*   **Food:** Needed to sustain population. Generated by Farms.
*   **Population:** Increases resource generation and unlocks advanced buildings. Grows over time based on Housing level.
*   **Prestige:** Earned by resetting your empire. Used for powerful permanent upgrades.
